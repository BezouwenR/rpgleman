.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
%THIS
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A non-static native method works on a specific instance of its class\[char46] This object is actually passed as a parameter to the native method by Javaâ„¢, but it does not appear in the prototype or procedure interface for the native method\[char46] In a Java method, the object instance is referred to by the Java reserved word this\[char46] In an \fIRPG\fR native method, the object instance is referred to by the \fB%THIS\fR built-in function\[char46]



.SH RETURN VALUE
\fB%THIS\fR returns an Object value that contains a reference to the class instance on whose behalf the native method is being called\[char46] \fB%THIS\fR is valid only in non-static native methods\[char46] This built-in gives non-static native methods access to the class instance\[char46]

 * Method "vacationDays" is a method in the class 'Employee'
D vacationDays    PR            10I 0 EXTPROC(*JAVA
D                                           : 'Employee'
D                                           : 'vacationDays')

 * Method "getId" is another method in the class 'Employee'
D getId           PR            10I 0 EXTPROC(*JAVA
D                                           : 'Employee'
D                                           : 'getId')

 * "vacationDays" is an RPG native method.  Since the STATIC keyword
 * is not used, it is an instance method.

 * Another Employee method must be called to get the Employee's
 * id-number.  This method requires an Object of class Employee.
 * We use %THIS as the Object parameter, to get the id-number for
 * the object that our native method "vacationDays" is working on.
