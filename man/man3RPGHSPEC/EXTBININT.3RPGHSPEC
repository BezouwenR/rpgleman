.SH NAME
EXTBININT
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
EXTBININT{(*NO | *YES)}
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION


 The \fIEXTBININT\fR keyword is used to process externally described fields with binary external format and zero decimal positions as if they had an external integer format\[char46] If not specified or specified with \fI*NO\fR, then an externally described binary field is processed with an external binary-decimal  format\[char46] If \fIEXTBININT\fR is specified, optionally with \fI*YES\fR, then an externally described field is processed as follows: 
.TP 5
.B \fIDDS\fR Definition



.TP 5
.B B(n,0) where 1 â¤ n â¤ 4
\fIINT\fR(5)
.TP 5
.B B(n,0) where 5 â¤ n â¤ 9
\fIINT\fR(10)
.PP
 



By specifying the \fIEXTBININT\fR keyword, your program can make use of the full range of \fIDDS\fR binary values available\[char46] (The range of \fIDDS\fR binary values is the same as for signed integers: -32768 to 32767 for a 5-digit field or -2147483648 to 2147483647 for a 10-digit field\[char46])
