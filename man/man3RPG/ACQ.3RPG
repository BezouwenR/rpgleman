The \fIACQ\fR operation acquires the program device specified by device-name for the \fIWORKSTN\fR file specified by workstn-file\[char46] If the device is available, \fIACQ\fR attaches it to the file\[char46] If it is not available or is already attached to the file, an error occurs\[char46]


To handle \fIACQ\fR exceptions (file status codes greater than 1000), either the operation code extender \[char39]E\[char39] or an error indicator ER can be specified, but not both\[char46] If no error indicator or \[char39]E\[char39] extender is specified, but the \fIINFSR\fR subroutine is specified, the \fIINFSR\fR receives control when an error/exception occurs\[char46] If no indicator, \[char39]E\[char39] extender, or \fIINFSR\fR subroutine is specified, the default error/exception handler receives control when an error/exception occurs\[char46] For more information on error handling, see File Exception/Errors\[char46]


No input or output operation occurs when the \fIACQ\fR operation is processed\[char46] \fIACQ\fR may be used with a multiple device file or, for error recovery purposes, with a single device file\[char46] One program may acquire and have the device available to any called program which shares the file and allow the called program to release the device\[char46] See the section on "Multiple-Device Files" in the chapter about using \fIWORKSTN\fR files in the Rational Development Studio for i: \fIILE\fR \fIRPG\fR Programmer\[char39]s Guide\[char46]
