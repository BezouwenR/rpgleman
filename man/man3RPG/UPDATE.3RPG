The \fIUPDATE\fR operation modifies the last locked record retrieved for processing from an update disk file or subfile\[char46] No other operation should be performed on the file between the input operation that retrieved the record and the \fIUPDATE\fR operation\[char46]


The name operand must be the name of a file or record format to be updated\[char46] A record format name is required with an externally described file\[char46] The record format name must be the name of the last record read from the file; otherwise, an error occurs\[char46] A file name as the name operand is required with a program described file\[char46]


.IP 1. 2
.RS
If the data-structure  operand is specified, the record is updated directly from the data structure\[char46]
.RE
.IP 2. 2
.RS
If name  refers to a program-described file, the data structure can be any data structure of the same length as the file\[char39]s declared record length\[char46]
.RE
.IP 3. 2
.RS


 If name  refers to an externally-described file or a record format from an externally described database file, the data structure must be a data structure defined from the same file or record format, with \fI*INPUT\fR, \fI*OUTPUT\fR, or \fI*ALL\fR specified as the second parameter of the \fILIKEREC\fR or \fIEXTNAME\fR keyword, or no second parameter specified for the \fILIKEREC\fR keyword\[char46] 


.RE
.IP 4. 2
.RS


 If name  refers to a subfile record format from an externally described display file, the data structure must be a data structure defined from the same file or record format, with \fI*OUTPUT\fR or \fI*ALL\fR specified as the second parameter of the \fILIKEREC\fR or \fIEXTNAME\fR keyword\[char46] 


.RE
.IP 5. 2
.RS
See File Operations  for information on how to define the data structure and how data is transferred between the data structure and the file\[char46]
.RE
.PP

A list of the fields to update can be specified using \fB%FIELDS\fR\[char46] The parameter to \fB%FIELDS\fR is a list of the field names to update\[char46] See the example at the end of \fB%FIELDS\fR (Fields to update) for an illustration of updating fields\[char46]


To handle \fIUPDATE\fR exceptions (file status codes greater than 1000), either the operation code extender \[char39]E\[char39] or an error indicator ER can be specified, but not both\[char46] For more information on error handling, see File Exception/Errors\[char46]


.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] When name  is a record format name, the current values in the program for the fields in the record definition are used to modify the record\[char46]
.RE
.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] If some but not all fields in a record are to be updated, either use the output specifications without an \fIUPDATE\fR operation or use \fB%FIELDS\fR to identify which fields to update\[char46]
.RE
.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] Before \fIUPDATE\fR is issued to a file or record, a valid input operation with lock (\fIREAD\fR, \fIREADC\fR, \fIREADE\fR, \fIREADP\fR, \fIREADPE\fR, \fICHAIN\fR, or primary/secondary file) must be issued to the same file or record\[char46] If the read operation returns with an error condition or if it was read without locking, the record is not locked and \fIUPDATE\fR cannot be issued\[char46] The record must be read again with the default of a blank operation extender to specify a lock request\[char46]
.RE
.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] Consecutive \fIUPDATE\fR operations to the same file or record are not valid\[char46] Intervening successful read operations must be issued to position to and lock the record to be updated\[char46]
.RE
.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] Beware of using the \fIUPDATE\fR operation on primary or secondary files during total calculations\[char46] At this stage in the \fIRPG\fR IV  cycle, the fields from the current record (the record that is about to be processed) have not yet been moved to the processing area\[char46] Therefore, the \fIUPDATE\fR operation updates the current record with the fields from the preceding record\[char46] Also, when the fields from the current record are moved to the processing area, they are the fields that were updated from the preceding record\[char46]
.RE
.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] For multiple device files, specify a subfile record format as the name  operand\[char46] The operation is processed for the program device identified in the fieldname specified using the \fIDEVID\fR keyword in the file specification\[char46] If the program device is not specified, the device used in the last successful input operation is used\[char46] This device must be the same one you specified for the input operation that must precede the \fIUPDATE\fR operation\[char46] You must not process input or output operations to other devices in between the input and \fIUPDATE\fR operations\[char46] If you do, your \fIUPDATE\fR operation will fail\[char46]
.RE
.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] For a display file which has multiple subfile record formats, you must not process read-for-update operations to one subfile record in between the input and \fIUPDATE\fR operations to another subfile in the same display file\[char46] If you do, the \fIUPDATE\fR operation will fail\[char46]
.RE
.IP "" 2
.RS
\[bu] An \fIUPDATE\fR operation is valid to a subfile record format as long as at least one successful input operation (\fIREADC\fR, \fICHAIN\fR) has occurred to that format name without an intervening input operation to a different format name\[char46] The record updated will be the record retrieved on the last successful input operation\[char46] This means that if you read a record successfully, then read unsuccessfully to the same format, an update will succeed, but will update the first record\[char46] This is different from the behavior of \fIDISK\fR files\[char46] 
To avoid updating the wrong record, check the resulting indicator or record-identifying indicator to ensure that a successful input operation has occurred before doing the update operation\[char46]
