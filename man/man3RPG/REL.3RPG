The \fIREL\fR operation releases the program device specified in program-device from the \fIWORKSTN\fR file specified in file-name\[char46]


Specify the program device name in the program-device operand\[char46] Use either a character field of length 10 or less, a character literal, or a named constant\[char46] Specify the file name in file-name operand\[char46]


To handle \fIREL\fR exceptions (file status codes greater than 1000), either the operation code extender \[char39]E\[char39] or an error indicator ER can be specified, but not both\[char46] For more information on error handling, see File Exception/Errors\[char46]


When there are no program devices acquired to a \fIWORKSTN\fR file, the next \fIREAD\fR-by-file-name or cycle-read gets an end-of-file condition\[char46] You must decide what the program does next\[char46] The \fIREL\fR operation may be used with a multiple device file or, for error recovery purpose, with a single device file\[char46]
