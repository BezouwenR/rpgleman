NAME
    rpgleman - Get man pages for ILE RPG

SYNOPSIS
    Download and install man pages built-in functions, and reserved keywords in
    ILE RPG.

INSTALL
    To install man pages run the following, ``sudo'' might be needed:

    $ make install

REBUILD MAN PAGES
    To download and rebuild from IBM one can run the following:

    $ make {all|bif|dcl-ds}

MAN PAGES
    Man pages are installed in ``/usr/share/man/man3RPG'' and can be accessed
    with:

        man 3RPG %TIME

VIM INTEGRATION
    One can change the ``keywordprg'' to search the proper man pages:

    :setlocal keywordprg=man\ 3RPG
    :setlocal iskeyword+=%

    Which makes ``K'' look for man pages in ``3RPG''.  If ``rpgle.vim''[0] is
    used then ``iskeyword'' is already updated.
