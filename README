NAME
    rpgleman - Get man pages for ILE RPG

SYNOPSIS
    Download and install man pages built-in functions, keywords, compiler
    directives, etc. in ILE RPG.

INSTALL
    To install man pages run the following, ``sudo'' might be needed:

    $ make install

REBUILD MAN PAGES
    To download and rebuild from IBM one can run the following:

    $ make {all|bif|kw|cd}

MAN PAGES
    Man pages for built-in functions and keywords are installed in
    ``/usr/share/man/man3RPG'' and can be accessed with:

    $ man 3RPG %TIME

    Man pages for compiler directives are installed in
    ``/usr/share/man/man3RPGCOMPDIR'' and can be accessed with:

    $ man 3RPGCOMPDIR %TIME

VIM INTEGRATION
    One can change the ``keywordprg'' to search the proper man pages:

    :setlocal keywordprg=man\ --sections=3RPG,3RPGCOMPDIR
    :setlocal iskeyword+=%

    Which makes ``K'' look for man pages in ``3RPG'' and ``3RPGCOMPDIR''.  If
    ``rpgle.vim''[0] is used then ``iskeyword'' is already updated.
