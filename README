NAME
    rpgleman - Get man pages for ILE RPG

SYNOPSIS
    Download and install man pages for built-in functions, declaration
    keywords, control keywords, calculation operations and compiler
    directives in ILE RPG.

INSTALL
    To install man pages run the following, ``sudo'' might be needed:

    $ make install

REBUILD MAN PAGES
    To download and rebuild from IBM one can run the following:

    $ make {all|bif|dkw|cop|hkw|cd}

    To speed up downloading one can if ``make'' supports is use ``-j'' to run
    multiply jobs at the same time.  See ``make(1)'' for more information.

DEPENDENCIES
    The following Perl modules is used and should be installed in order to
    rebuild man pages:

    HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath
    HTTP::Tiny
    IO::Socket::SSL

MAN PAGES
    Man pages for built-in functions, declaration keywords, and calculation
    operators are installed in ``/usr/share/man/man3RPG'' and can be accessed
    with:

    $ man 3RPG %TIME

    Man pages for control keywords are installed in
    ``/usr/share/man/man3RPGHSPEC'' and can be accessed with:

    $ man 3RPGHSPEC BNDDIR

    Man pages for compiler directives are installed in
    ``/usr/share/man/man3RPGCOMPDIR'' and can be accessed with:

    $ man 3RPGCOMPDIR DEFINE

VIM INTEGRATION
    One can change the ``keywordprg'' to search the proper man pages:

    :setlocal keywordprg=man\ --sections=3RPG,3RPGHSPEC,3RPGCOMPDIR
    :setlocal iskeyword+=%,-

    Which makes ``K'' look for man pages in ``3RPG'', ``3RPGHSPEC'' and
    ``3RPGCOMPDIR''.  If ``rpgle.vim''[0] is used then ``iskeyword'' is already
    updated.
